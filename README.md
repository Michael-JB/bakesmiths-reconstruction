# Bakesmiths Reconstruction
A collection of files summarising my reconstruction of the upstairs interior of Bakesmiths, a caf√© on Whiteladies Road, Bristol.

The project was completed in Autodesk Maya and rendered with the Arnold renderer. Original binaries for both the geometric and shaded versions of the scene are included in the `Binaries` folder.

## Ambient Occlusion Render

This render demonstrates the plain geometry of the interior. The scene was created from scratch using a range of techniques as detailed in `Reports/architecture_report.pdf`.

## Shaded Render

This render forms the second stage of the recreation, namely shading and texturing the scene -- `Reports/shading_report.pdf` summarises this stage.
